                                        recommends that the proof be printed out at 100% to check actual position,

                                        pieces than ordered.&nbsp; Printing trade standards allow for underages or
                                        overages of up to 5%. Therefore, if exact quantity is needed, then it is
                                        suggested that customers should order 10% over the required quantity.</span>

                                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                                        Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                                        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                                        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                                        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                                        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                                        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
