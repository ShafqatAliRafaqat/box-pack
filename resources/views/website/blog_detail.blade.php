                                    Creativity is one of the most important life skills one can have. Especially, when
                                    we
                                    are talking about the packaging industry, creativity is deemed essential. Why? As
                                    much
                                    as the customer focuses on the quality of the product, proper packaging is of equal
                                    importance. Moreove Whiler, packaging creates the first impression of the product on
                                    the
                                    customer, hence it is important to ensure a good one. we are talking about the
                                    impression, there are some vitals of proper packaging design; type, color, function,
                                    design and, sustainability. Let’s delve into the details.

                                <h3><strong>Why is creativity important?</strong></h3>
                                <p>
                                    When was the last time you went to buy a toothbrush for your child? While I agree
                                    that
                                    the reputation of a brand goes a long way, but a cool design will always make the
                                    product stand out. Hence, we know that creative and interesting product packages are
                                    eye-catchers. So, you will likely choose a toothbrush whose package is shaped like
                                    an
                                    alligator or there is a superhero animation on it.

                                    Now based on the vitals, here are some of the examples to emphasize the importance
                                    of
                                    creativity in the packaging industry.

                                    A pattern is an incredibly powerful and versatile tool for communicating a brand’s
                                    personality. These days we see patterns within the packaging, apparel, decoration
                                    and
                                    what not? The bottom line is, it provides a distinction to your product.
                                    Furthermore,
                                    patterns can be stripes, polka dots, and/or geometric shapes in different colors.

                                    The packaging industry is all about innovation and creativity these days. Generally,
                                    some
                                    companies claim the uniqueness and durability of their products. However, the
                                    customers
                                    get the benefit of the doubt. Brace yourself, here are the two examples of literal
                                    claims from Festina and Nike Air.

                                    offers an engineered waterproof watch. The watch comes in a transparent bag filled

                                    distilled water. It is a little too literal and convincing packaging solution that
                                    demonstrates the advantage of the watch without the need for words.

                                    the customer. The company offers a pair of shoes in a transparent package filled

                                    Evolvia olive oil as the brand&#8217;s first product. The bottle of the oil is
                                    minimalistic. He hoped that the consumers would reuse the glass bottle as a pourer

                                    after the initial supply of oil was gone.

                                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                                        Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
                                        unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
                                        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                                        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                                        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                                        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
                                        versions of Lorem Ipsum.
